# ExtractFloraOrganizedV0
First draft of reorganization of the extract flora pipeline

Purpose of this version / branch: 
I am putting together a first draft for Maryam's dissertation in this branch. Since I tried many different things to more comprehensively cover the nuances of the flora, I have multiple scripts that are almost identical. So in the interest of time I am only putting together a working version. We will work on a better organized and complete version. Logically this version should give us a lower bound for the accuracy of the output. 

Important dependencies: 
- PyMuPDF 1.21.1: Python bindings for the MuPDF 1.21.1 library.
Version date: 2022-12-13 00:00:01.
Built for Python 3.10 on darwin (64-bit).
- please make the output/local/index_output , output/Oct2024 folder ,and output/local/main_text/ folders in root repo before running index script (will build the right repos in the script in future versions)
